#Creating an 8-bit functional calculator simulation in Logicly software is an excellent project that involves designing and simulating basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using digital logic circuits. Here's a description to help guide you through the process:

Project Description: 8-bit Functional Calculator Simulation in Logicly
Objective: To design and simulate an 8-bit calculator using Logicly software that can perform the four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Tools Used:

Logicly Software: A digital logic simulator used for creating and testing logic circuits.
Features:

8-bit Input and Output:

The calculator will accept two 8-bit binary numbers as inputs.
The result of the operation will also be represented as an 8-bit binary number.
Arithmetic Operations:

Addition: Using an 8-bit full adder circuit to sum two 8-bit binary numbers.
Subtraction: Implemented by using an 8-bit adder along with a two's complement system to handle negative numbers.
Multiplication: Created by combining shift registers and adders to perform binary multiplication.
Division: Implemented through a combination of subtractors and shift operations to achieve binary division.
Control Unit:

A control unit is designed using multiplexers and logic gates to select the desired arithmetic operation based on user input.
User Interface:

The interface includes switches to input the two 8-bit numbers and select the desired operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
LEDs or a digital display is used to show the output in binary form.
Circuit Design:

Addition Circuit: The circuit consists of an 8-bit full adder created by chaining together individual full adders.
Subtraction Circuit: Uses the same adder circuit but with the second operand passed through a two's complement conversion.
Multiplication Circuit: Utilizes a series of adders and shift registers to perform multiplication, where each bit of one operand is multiplied by the entire second operand and then shifted accordingly.
Division Circuit: Implemented using a combination of subtractors and a shift-and-subtract algorithm to perform division.
Simulation and Testing:

The circuit is simulated in Logicly software, allowing you to test various input combinations and verify the correctness of each arithmetic operation.
Test cases include operations with both positive and negative numbers, ensuring the correct handling of overflow and underflow conditions.
Outcome: Upon completion, you will have a fully functional 8-bit calculator that accurately performs the four basic arithmetic operations. The project not only demonstrates the power of digital logic but also provides a strong foundation in understanding how basic calculators work at the hardware level.
