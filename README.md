# Creating an 8-bit functional calculator simulation in Logicly software is an excellent project that involves designing and simulating basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using digital logic circuits. Here's a description to help guide you through the process:

Project Description: 8-bit Functional Calculator Simulation in Logicly
Objective: To design and simulate an 8-bit calculator using Logicly software that can perform the four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Tools Used:

Logicly Software: A digital logic simulator used for creating and testing logic circuits.
Features:

8-bit Input and Output:

The calculator will accept two 8-bit binary numbers as inputs.
The result of the operation will also be represented as an 8-bit binary number.
Arithmetic Operations:

Addition: Using an 8-bit full adder circuit to sum two 8-bit binary numbers.
Subtraction: Implemented by using an 8-bit adder along with a two's complement system to handle negative numbers.
Multiplication: Created by combining shift registers and adders to perform binary multiplication.
Division: Implemented through a combination of subtractors and shift operations to achieve binary division.
Control Unit:

A control unit is designed using multiplexers and logic gates to select the desired arithmetic operation based on user input.
User Interface:

The interface includes switches to input the two 8-bit numbers and select the desired operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
LEDs or a digital display is used to show the output in binary form.
Circuit Design:

Addition Circuit: The circuit consists of an 8-bit full adder created by chaining together individual full adders.
Subtraction Circuit: Uses the same adder circuit but with the second operand passed through a two's complement conversion.
Multiplication Circuit: Utilizes a series of adders and shift registers to perform multiplication, where each bit of one operand is multiplied by the entire second operand and then shifted accordingly.
Division Circuit: Implemented using a combination of subtractors and a shift-and-subtract algorithm to perform division.
Simulation and Testing:

The circuit is simulated in Logicly software, allowing you to test various input combinations and verify the correctness of each arithmetic operation.
Test cases include operations with both positive and negative numbers, ensuring the correct handling of overflow and underflow conditions.
Outcome: Upon completion, you will have a fully functional 8-bit calculator that accurately performs the four basic arithmetic operations. The project not only demonstrates the power of digital logic but also provides a strong foundation in understanding how basic calculators work at the hardware level.


# Here's a step-by-step guide on how to install Logicly and deploy your 8-bit calculator simulation:

Step 1: Download Logicly Software
Visit the Logicly Website:

Go to the [visit the Logicly website](https://logic.ly/) or search for "Logicly download" in your preferred search engine.
Choose the Appropriate Version:

Logicly is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Choose the version that matches your operating system.
Download the Installer:

Click the download link for your OS to get the installer file.
Step 2: Install Logicly
Run the Installer:

Once the download is complete, locate the installer file (e.g., LogiclySetup.exe for Windows) and double-click to run it.
Follow the Installation Prompts:

Accept the license agreement and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
Choose the installation directory if prompted, or use the default location.
Complete Installation:

After installation, Logicly should be available in your applications or start menu.
Step 3: Launch Logicly
Open Logicly:

Launch the Logicly application from your start menu or applications folder.
Explore the Interface:

Familiarize yourself with the interface, which includes a toolbar with various logic gates, inputs, outputs, and other components.
Step 4: Design the 8-bit Calculator
Create a New Project:

Start a new project by clicking on File > New or simply clicking on the blank workspace.
Design the Circuit:

Input Switches: Drag and drop input switches to represent the 8-bit numbers.
Logic Gates: Use AND, OR, XOR, NOT gates, and adders to design the circuits for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Multiplexers: Use multiplexers to select between different operations based on user input.
Outputs: Add LEDs or a binary display to show the output.
Wire the Components:

Connect the components by clicking and dragging between the terminals to create wires.
Ensure that your circuit is logically correct by carefully placing and wiring each component.
Test the Circuit:

Use the input switches to set values for your 8-bit numbers.
Observe the output on the LEDs or binary display to ensure the correct result is displayed for each operation.
Step 5: Save and Export Your Project
Save Your Project:

Save your work frequently by clicking File > Save and choosing a location on your computer.
Export the Circuit:

If you want to share your design, you can export it by clicking File > Export Image to save a graphical representation of your circuit.
Step 6: Deploy and Share Your Simulation
Share the Logicly File:

You can share the .logicly file with others who have the Logicly software installed. This allows them to open, view, and interact with your simulation.
Create a Demonstration:

Record a video demonstration or create a detailed walkthrough of how your 8-bit calculator works. This can be helpful for presentations or sharing with others who may not have Logicly.
Upload to a Repository:

If you want to make your project publicly available, consider uploading the Logicly file and any related documentation to a platform like GitHub. This allows others to download and try out your simulation.
Step 7: Troubleshooting and Optimization
Debugging:

If the circuit isn't functioning as expected, double-check the connections and logic gates.
Use the simulation tools in Logicly to step through the circuit and identify any issues.
Optimize the Circuit:
